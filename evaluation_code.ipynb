    "1. Data Preparation\n",
    "We load the exhibition dataset containing traits like Nationality, Gender, and Exhibition Role (e.g., Artist, Curator).\n",
    "\n",
    "These text-based traits are converted into numbers using LabelEncoder to make them usable by machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model Training\n",
    "A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model is trained using the encoded traits to find exhibitions similar to a user’s profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. User Simulation\n",
    "We randomly pick 5 unique combinations of user traits (Nationality, Gender, Role) to simulate real users for evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Recommendations\n",
    "For each simulated user, we find their 10 nearest exhibition matches using the trained KNN model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Relevance Criteria (Weighted Scoring)\n",
    "Each recommendation is evaluated for relevance using this weighted scheme:\n",
    "\n",
    "Trait\tWeight\n",
    "Nationality\t0.5\n",
    "Gender\t0.2\n",
    "Role\t0.3\n",
    "A recommendation is considered relevant if the total score of matched traits is greater than or equal to 0.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If Nationality and Role both match: 0.5 + 0.3 = 0.8 → Relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "If only Gender matches: 0.2 → Not Relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Metric Calculation\n",
    "For each user, we calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision: How many of the recommended exhibitions are actually relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall: How many relevant exhibitions were successfully recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "F1 Score: A balance between Precision and Recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Final Output\n",
    "For every user, the system displays:\n",
    "\n",
    "Their traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "URLs of recommended exhibitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance scores for each recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then it computes and prints average evaluation scores across all 5 users."
